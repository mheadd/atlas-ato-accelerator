# ATLAS: ATO Accelerator

* ATLAS - **A**utomated **T**erraform **L**everaging **A**I for **S**ecurity
* ATO - **A**uthority **T**o **O**perate

## Overview

This project proposes using AI coding assistants to generate NIST-compliant Terraform infrastructure code from the outset, shifting security compliance left in the development process to reduce [ATO timelines](https://atos.open-control.org/steps/#top) and improve security posture.

## Core Concept

Create specialized guidance documents that AI assistants read before generating infrastructure code, encoding NIST 800-53 control implementation patterns, secure baseline configurations, and ATO documentation requirements. This ensures infrastructure is both functional and ATO-ready from the start.

## Implementation Approaches

The proposal outlines three options:

1. **AGENTS.md Files** - Repository-specific markdown files that AI assistants automatically read
2. **Claude Skill Architecture** - Formal skills with comprehensive NIST-Terraform guidance  
3. **Hybrid Multi-Layered System** - Combines organization-level skills with project-specific guidance

## Key Components

- **Knowledge Encoding** - Translating NIST requirements into Terraform patterns
- **AI-Assisted Generation** - Producing compliant infrastructure code through IDE assistants
- **Validation & Documentation** - Policy-as-code validation plus automated SSP generation
- **Continuous Compliance** - Maintaining consistency as infrastructure evolves

## Expected Outcomes

- 30-50% reduction in ATO preparation time
- Infrastructure code that is compliant-by-default
- Standardized security implementations across teams
- ATO documentation generated alongside infrastructure code
- Reduced friction between development and security teams

## Prototype Plan

A 10-week phased approach:
1. Foundation (Weeks 1-2) - 5 high-impact NIST controls, 3 common resources
2. Documentation Integration (Weeks 3-4) - SSP generation from Terraform
3. Validation Loop (Weeks 5-6) - Policy-as-code implementation
4. User Testing (Weeks 7-8) - Real-world validation with developers
5. Expansion Planning (Weeks 9-10) - Roadmap for full implementation
