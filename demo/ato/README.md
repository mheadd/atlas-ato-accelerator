# ATO Compliance Artifacts Directory

This directory will contain compliance documentation generated from the Terraform infrastructure code.

Generated files will include:
- `compliance-summary.md` - Summary of NIST 800-53 controls implemented
- `control-matrix.csv` - Mapping of controls to infrastructure resources
- Additional compliance reports as needed

These artifacts are generated using AI assistance to extract compliance information from the Terraform files, demonstrating how documentation can be derived from infrastructure-as-code rather than maintained separately.

## Note

This directory is intentionally empty in the repository. Files will be created when you run through the compliance documentation phase of the demo (Phase 5) following the instructions in `demo/README.md`.
