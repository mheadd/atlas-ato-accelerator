# Terraform Files Directory

This directory will contain Terraform files generated during the demo.

Generated files will include:
- `provider.tf` - Terraform provider configuration for LocalStack
- `variables.tf` - Input variables for infrastructure
- `rds.tf` - RDS PostgreSQL database configuration
- `k8s-deployment.tf` - Kubernetes deployment manifest
- `k8s-service.tf` - Kubernetes service manifest
- `outputs.tf` - Output values for integration

These files are generated on-the-fly during the demo using AI assistance with the `AGENTS.md` guidance file.

## Note

This directory is intentionally empty in the repository. Files will be created when you run through the demo following the instructions in `demo/README.md`.
