# ATLAS ATO Accelerator

## Project Overview
ATLAS (Automated Terraform Leveraging AI for Security) is a system for generating NIST-compliant infrastructure-as-code from the start, rather than retrofitting compliance after development. It uses AI coding assistants guided by specialized knowledge files to create Terraform that's both functional and ATO-ready by default.

## Core Problem
Federal agencies typically develop infrastructure code for functionality first, then retrofit security compliance during the Authority to Operate (ATO) process. This reactive approach creates delays, rework, and inconsistenciesâ€”often adding months to deployment timelines.

## Solution Approach
Create specialized guidance documents (AGENTS.md files or Claude Skills) that AI assistants read before generating infrastructure code. These documents encode:
- NIST 800-53 control implementation patterns mapped to Terraform resources
- Secure baseline configurations for common infrastructure components  
- Documentation requirements for ATO artifact generation
- Organization-specific standards and approved architectural patterns

## Key Benefits
- 30-50% reduction in ATO preparation time
- Infrastructure code that's compliant-by-default
- Standardized security implementations across teams
- ATO documentation generated alongside infrastructure code
- Reduced friction between development and security teams

## Implementation Options
1. **AGENTS.md Files**: Repository-specific guidance that AI assistants automatically read
2. **Claude Skill Architecture**: Formal skills with comprehensive NIST-Terraform guidance
3. **Hybrid Multi-Layered System**: Organization-level base skills + project-specific customizations

## Demo Available
Complete hands-on demo using Kind (Kubernetes) + LocalStack (AWS simulation) that:
- Generates NIST-compliant S3 buckets, PostgreSQL databases, Kubernetes deployments
- Shows security controls embedded in infrastructure code
- Automatically generates compliance documentation from Terraform
- Deploys working application locally (~1 hour walkthrough)

## Technical Components
- **Guidance Files**: AGENTS.md with NIST 800-53 patterns
- **AI Integration**: Works with Claude, GitHub Copilot, other coding assistants
- **Validation**: Policy-as-code tools (OPA, Sentinel) for drift detection
- **Documentation**: Automated SSP generation from infrastructure code

## Project Status
- Prototype/demo phase with working examples
- 10-week implementation plan designed
- Focus on 5 high-impact NIST controls initially
- Designed to complement existing compliance tools

## Repository Structure
- `/demo/`: Complete walkthrough with AGENTS.md guidance
- `/examples/`: Sample compliance artifacts generated by demo
- `/docs/`: Project documentation and GitHub Pages site
- `PROPOSAL.md`: Detailed technical proposal and implementation plan
- `README.md`: Project overview and links

## Use Cases
- Federal agencies seeking faster ATO timelines
- Organizations implementing NIST 800-53 controls
- DevSecOps teams wanting compliance-as-code
- Infrastructure teams using Terraform at scale

## Compliance Standards
Primary focus on NIST 800-53 Rev 5 controls, extensible to:
- FedRAMP requirements
- CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)
- Other compliance frameworks
