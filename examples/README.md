# Example Compliance Artifacts

This directory contains **sample compliance documentation** generated by running through the ATLAS ATO Accelerator demo. These files demonstrate what AI-assisted compliance artifact generation produces when following the walkthrough in [`demo/README.md`](../demo/README.md).

## Files in This Directory

- **`compliance-summary.md`** - Summary of NIST 800-53 controls implemented in the demo infrastructure, showing which resources satisfy each control requirement
- **`control-matrix.csv`** - Control implementation matrix mapping each Terraform resource to the NIST controls it implements, including implementation status and evidence location

## How These Were Generated

These artifacts were created during **Phase 5** of the [demo walkthrough](../demo) using AI coding assistants (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to analyze the Terraform infrastructure code and generate compliance documentation automatically.

The prompts used were:
- **Prompt 8**: Generate compliance summary document analyzing all NIST 800-53 controls implemented
- **Prompt 9**: Generate control implementation matrix mapping resources to controls

## Key Takeaways

These examples demonstrate:

✅ **Automated Documentation** - Compliance artifacts are derived from infrastructure code, not maintained separately

✅ **Control Traceability** - Clear mapping between infrastructure resources and NIST controls

✅ **AI-Assisted Compliance** - Using AI to extract and document security controls from IaC

✅ **Shift-Left Security** - Controls are embedded in code from the start, documentation follows

## Generating Your Own

To generate your own compliance artifacts:

1. Complete the demo walkthrough in [`demo/README.md`](../demo/README.md) through Phase 4
2. Use the prompts in Phase 5 to generate compliance documentation
3. Your AI assistant will analyze the Terraform files in `demo/tf/` and create similar artifacts in `demo/ato/`

## Note

These are **example outputs** for reference. When you run the demo yourself, your generated files will be placed in `demo/ato/` (which is excluded from git via `.gitignore`). These example files are kept in the repository to show what the final output looks like.
